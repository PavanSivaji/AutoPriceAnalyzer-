# PredictiveAutoPricing: Vehicle Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
**PredictiveAutoPricing** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting vehicle prices based on various features such as engine specifications, horsepower, fuel type, and more. This project employs different regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to build a robust model for accurate price predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Handling missing values and outliers
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search
- Visualization of actual vs predicted prices
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² Score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
